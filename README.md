# 2048
A variant of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) which lets you start well into the game.

2048 itself is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun, and to save Amy some wear and tear on her fingers. [Play it here!](http://jimstudt.github.io/2048.)

## Donations
Gabriel Cirulli made the original in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means he doesn't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`. Thank you very much!
